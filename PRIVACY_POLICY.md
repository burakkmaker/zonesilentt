# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-12-29

This Privacy Policy describes how the **ZoneSilent** mobile application (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information.

## Summary

- The App uses your location to create and monitor “zones” so it can change the device ringer mode when you enter/exit those zones.
- The App stores your saved zones locally on your device.
- The App does not sell your personal data.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

The App may collect and process:

- **Approximate location** and/or **precise location** (depending on permissions you grant).
- **Background location** if you grant background location access, so geofences can work when the App is not open.

Location is used only for enabling the core functionality (zone creation and geofence monitoring).

### Zone Information You Create

The App stores the zones you create (for example: zone name, latitude/longitude, radius, selected mode) **locally on your device**.

### Device / App Data

The App may access device features required for functionality, such as:

- Notification/Do Not Disturb related settings (to apply silent/vibrate mode where supported by Android).

The App does not intentionally collect unique advertising identifiers at this time.

## How We Use Information

We use the collected information to:

- Create, display, and manage your saved zones.
- Register and monitor geofences.
- Change the device ringer mode (silent/vibrate) when entering or exiting zones.
- Improve stability and performance.

## Data Storage and Sharing

- **On-device storage:** Your zones are stored locally on your device.
- **Sharing:** We do not share your personal data with third parties for marketing.

If you later enable third-party services (for example, analytics or advertising), this policy should be updated accordingly.

## Permissions

Depending on your Android version and your usage, the App may request permissions such as:

- Location (foreground)
- Background location
- Notifications
- Do Not Disturb access (Notification Policy access)

You can change or revoke permissions anytime in your device settings.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information stored by the App. However, no method of storage is 100% secure.

## Your Choices

- You can delete zones you created within the App.
- You can revoke location permissions in system settings (geofence features may stop working).

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
